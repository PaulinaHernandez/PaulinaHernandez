I'm an AI/ML Engineer with a deep-seated passion for turning complex challenges into innovative solutions. I love diving into the world of Large Language Models (LLM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), transforming ideas into reality. Whether it's brainstorming the initial concept or deploying the final product.

What I Bring to the Table

Programming Expertise: Skilled in Python and SQL, specializing in the development of machine learning models and applications utilizing PyTorch, alongside experience with TensorFlow, Langchain, and OpenAI's LLama2 for advanced AI projects.
Cloud Computing: Proficient with Azure ML and AWS, making sure our AI/ML projects run smoothly and efficiently in the cloud.
Data Visualization Expertise: Adept in leveraging Matplotlib, Seaborn, and PowerBI to create advanced visual representations of data. Exceptional at translating intricate data sets into coherent, compelling narratives that support strategic decision-making throughout an organization.

The world of AI/ML is always evolving, and so am I. Currently, I'm studying a Data Science course from the University of Austin Texas, and getting a Azure Associate Data science Certification.

A Bit More About Me:

I'm a problem solver at heart, and I believe that there's no challenge too big to tackle with the right data and a dash of creativity. I thrive in collaborative environments, working alongside people from all sorts of backgrounds who are passionate about how technology can impact our society to solve real life problems.

When I'm not geeking out over the latest AI trend, you might find me exploring new tech meetups, sharing knowledge with peers, or just enjoying a good coffee while plotting the next big thing.

I'm on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate and make a positive impact with AI/ML. Whether you're in need of a team player for your next project or just want to chat about the future of technology, feel free to reach out!
