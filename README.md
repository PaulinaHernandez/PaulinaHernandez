### Hola I'm Paulina!

I've found a strong passion for AI during the last couple of years. Through my different experiences in Project Management and Software Development, I have dedicated myself to learn and build AI and Deep learning projects.

I love diving into the world of Large Language Models (LLM) and  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). As for Generative AI, I've play around Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) this last one just for the love of learning.

I'm committed to excelling in this field as part of my journey, I just concluded Data Science postgraduate course from the University of Austin Texas and I'm currently studying for my Azure Associate Data Science Certification. 

As an AI enthusiasm I like to engage with the community, whether through tech meetups or hackathons to build AI projects, I like collaborative environments and working with diverse teams sometimes as a developer and sometimes as a project manager planning and overseeing from conception to completion, I love to bridge people and technology.

I'm on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate and make a positive impact with AI. Whether you're in need of a team player for your next project or just want to chat about the future of technology, feel free to reach out!

Technical skills:

Programming Expertise: Python and SQL, specializing in the development of machine learning models and applications utilizing PyTorch, TensorFlow, Langchain, and OpenAI, Gemini, LLama2.
Cloud Computing: Proficient with Azure ML and AWS
Data Visualization Expertise: Adept in leveraging Matplotlib, Seaborn, and PowerBI

I'm on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate and make a positive impact with AI/ML. Whether you're in need of a team player for your next project or just want to chat about the future of technology, feel free to reach out! ðŸ’¬
