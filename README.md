### Hola I'm Paulina!

I've found a strong passion for AI during the last couple of years. Through my different experiences in Project Management and Software Development, I have dedicated myself to learn and build AI/ML projects.

I love diving into the world of Large Language Models (LLM) and I also enjoy very much to work with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). I have worked with image classification using Pytorch and Tensorflow. As for Generative AI, I also have some experience with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) this last one just for the love of learning.

I'm committed to excelling in this field as part of my journey, I just concluded Data Science postgraduate course from the University of Austin Texas and I'm currently studying for my Azure Associate Data Science Certification. 

As an AI enthusiasm I like to engage with the community, whether through tech meetups or hackathons to build AI projects as I like collaborative environments and working with diverse teams to sometimes as a developer and sometimes as a project manager planning and overseeing a project from conception to completion, I love to bridge people and technology.

I'm on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate and make a positive impact with AI/ML. Whether you're in need of a team player for your next project or just want to chat about the future of technology, feel free to reach out!

Technical skills:

Programming Expertise: Python and SQL, specializing in the development of machine learning models and applications utilizing PyTorch, TensorFlow, Langchain, and OpenAI, Gemini, LLama2.
Cloud Computing: Proficient with Azure ML and AWS
Data Visualization Expertise: Adept in leveraging Matplotlib, Seaborn, and PowerBI

I'm on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate and make a positive impact with AI/ML. Whether you're in need of a team player for your next project or just want to chat about the future of technology, feel free to reach out! ðŸ’¬
